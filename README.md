# Honeypot Threat Intelligence System

A real-time cybersecurity honeypot system designed to detect, monitor, and analyze malicious network activities and cyber threats. This project simulates vulnerable services to attract attackers and collect threat intelligence data.

## Overview

This honeypot system acts as a decoy to lure cyber attackers, capturing detailed information about attack patterns, methods, and origins. The system provides real-time monitoring and analysis of security threats including SSH brute force attacks, port scanning, botnet activities, and web exploitation attempts.

## Features

- **Real-Time Attack Monitoring**: Live feed of incoming attacks with detailed information
- **Geographic Threat Mapping**: Visual representation of attack origins worldwide
- **Attack Pattern Analysis**: Identification and classification of different attack types
- **Severity Assessment**: Automated threat level classification (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logs of IP addresses, ports, protocols, and timestamps
- **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly interface for threat intelligence visualization

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Server Actions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for storing attack logs and analytics)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Security Tools**: Custom honeypot protocols and detection algorithms

## Attack Detection Capabilities

The system can detect and analyze various types of cyber attacks:

- SSH Brute Force Attacks
- Port Scanning Activities
- Botnet Scanning Operations
- Malware Drop Attempts
- Web Exploitation Attempts
- DDoS Attack Patterns

## Project Goals

- Enhance understanding of real-world cyber threat landscapes
- Collect actionable threat intelligence for security research
- Develop skills in cybersecurity monitoring and incident response
- Contribute to the broader cybersecurity community with attack pattern data

## Key Insights

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into:
- Common attack vectors used by malicious actors
- Geographic distribution of cyber threats
- Timing patterns of automated attacks
- Evolution of threat actor techniques
